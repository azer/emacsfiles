;;;
;;; Alternate mode to display line numbers. While there are other
;;; functions that also do this, lineno is better suited for large
;;; files since it does not put line numbers throughout the buffer,
;;; but only in the visible window. This way the size of the file does
;;; not matter, it is the window size which determines the update
;;; speed, and this is fast enough.
;;;
;;; It only works in file buffers so far, and in them only for regular
;;; editing. Anything else which changes the buffer position from
;;; outside the buffer (ediff, etc.) will not update the line numbers.
;;; You can either live without them, do any command in the buffer, or
;;; add lineno-post-command to the appropriate hook.
;;;
;;; There appears to be an emacs bug which causes an infinite loop in
;;; fill-paragraph. See comment and kludge below.
;;;
;;; As with other line numbering functions, tabs work funny, so it is
;;; best to use spaces instead of tabs if the indenting is important
;;; to you. Or, I think if you use "\t" as lineno-padding all will
;;; display correctly.
;;; 
;;; To install: put in path, (require 'lineno) To use: M-x
;;; lineno-minor-mode <RET> to toggle it.  The face used for the line
;;; numbers can be set in a custom group: "M-x customize-group <RET>
;;; lineno <RET>" If the face for the line numbers is larger than the
;;; buffer face there will be some minor problems, like odd scrolling
;;; behavior or line numbers occasionally repeated. To fix this
;;; behavior make sure your line number face is no larger than the
;;; buffer face, and/or turn on lineno-bigface-fix.

This is a workaround for the big-face problem: if the line number face
is larger than the buffer face, it is possible for point to be off
screen after painting the window. This can also happen if point is
near the bottom and inserting line numbers causes lines to wrap. In
any case it is not a disaster, it will repaint properly after the next
command. Setting this option to t causes the lineno function to be
called recursively, which will recenter the screen around the actual
position of POINT.

There can still be a little funny behavior with this kludge in, so the
best choice is to keep your lineno face reasonably small. While I
don't see how, it is possible that some funny configuration could
cause this to loop indefinitely."
